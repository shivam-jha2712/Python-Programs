# Numeric DataTypes : 1.int, 2.float, 3.complex
# 1. int:
#       a. it has no upper or lower limit in terms of size in python only depends upon computer memory
#       b. it can contain any number that is not decimal (i.e; Decimals, Binary, Octal, HexaDecimal)
# Examples in code:
print(type(10))
print(type(0b10)) # this is binary (binary prefix is 0b or 0B)
print(type(0o16)) # this is octal (octal prefix is 0o or 0O)
print(type(0x69)) # this is hexadecimal (hexadecimal prefix is 0x or 0X)

# 2. float:
#           a. it contains all the decimal values and any kind of decimal values
#           b. similar to int in float as well it does not contains any upperlimit for the size to be stored in python

# Examples in code:
print(type(10.75))
