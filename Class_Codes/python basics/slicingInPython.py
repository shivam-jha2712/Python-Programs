string1 = "Prepinsta Prime"
#        -15            -1

# Now in order to print some things very specifically from python what we need to do is we need to use
# Slicing in order to print or get something specifically within a range on the basis of there index

# 0 1 2 3 4 in slicing only gets you elements from 0 to 3 index and not upto 4
# for example:
print(string1[0:4])
