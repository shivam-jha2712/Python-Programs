# string1 = "Jai Shri Ram"
# print(type(string1))
# print(type("Jai Shri Ram"))
# print(type(10))
# print(type(10.7))

# Below is assigning data to variables
#
x = "Shivam"
y = "is"
z = "Ram Bhakt"
#
print(x + " " + y + " " + z)

# Else you can even do the same as above but using comma operator and thus having no issue of providing seperators
print(x, y, z)

# Why python is said as a strongly typed language
# x = 27
# y = "Shivam"

# inbuilt functions like isinstance() and issubclass() are used to test the type of the variable automatically and
# assign its correct usage
# print(x + y)
